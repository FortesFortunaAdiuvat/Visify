🧭 Project Phases & Learning Milestones
Phase 0: Define & Discover (1–2 weeks)
Objectives: Outline core features (media catalog, playback, search, YouTube proxy).

Research APIs: e.g., TMDb, YouTube Data API, Spotify public endpoints, podcasts.

Tech choices: BLoC/Provider/Riverpod for state management, backend (Firebase, Node.js, etc.).

Prep: Set up project repo, CI/CD basics, environment config.

Phase 1: Foundations — Flutter & Dart Mastery (2–4 weeks)
Dart fundamentals: variables, OOP, null safety, async/await.

Flutter basics: widgets, stateful/stateless, layouts, Material & Cupertino

.

Navigation patterns: Bottom tabs, side menu, routing.

Networking: REST calls, API integration (TMDb, podcasts).

Data layer: Models, repositories, JSON parsing.

Phase 3: Media Playback & UI (3–4 weeks)
Implement components:

Song & podcast playback (audio players).

Movie trailers via embedded YouTube player.

UI/UX polish: Carousels, search screens, media details layout.

Responsive design: Supporting mobile, tablet, desktop.

Phase 4: State Management & Persistence (2–3 weeks)
State solutions: Choose Bloc / Riverpod / Provider.

Local storage: Favorites, history, downloads via SQLite or Hive.

Sync and offline support.

Phase 5: Authentication & Profiles (2 weeks)
User login: Email/password, OAuth (Spotify/Google).

Profile screens: Preferences, settings, personalize UI themes.

Phase 6: Advanced Features & Integrations (3–4 weeks)
Dynamic metadata: Fetch ratings from IMDB or TMDb, show trailers.

Proxy YouTube: Embed or API proxy with aggregated metadata.

Notifications: New episode alerts via push notifications.

Playback controls: Background audio, media notifications, seek bar.

Phase 7: Testing, Performance & Deployment (2–3 weeks)
Testing: Unit (Dart), widget, and integration testing.

Performance: Profile, optimize startup and scrolling.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Codemagic.

Release: Build for iOS, Android, Web, Desktop.

Phase 8: Polish & Launch (2 weeks)
Beta testing: Gather feedback, track crashes.

UI improvements: Animations, transitions, theming.

App Store prep: Assets, keywords, descriptions.

📅 Sample Timeline & Agile Rhythm
Duration: 4–6 months total.

Sprint cadence: 2‑week Agile sprints.

Regular check-ins: Demo every sprint end; adapt priorities.

Buffer: Contingency ~15–20% of total time .

✅ Next Steps
Finalize features & API integrations.

Set up your repo & initial Flutter app skeleton.

Begin Phase 1: learn Dart and Flutter basics, build a simple prototype.

After Phase 1, revisit scope & adjust timelines.

You’ll be learning Flutter & Dart while building a real-world, cross-platform media app—a great learning synergy. Let me know if you'd like help drafting your first sprint backlog or picking specific state‑management or playback packages!
