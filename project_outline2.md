ðŸ§­ Project Phases & Learning Milestones (Updated Tech Stack)
Phase 0: Define & Discover (1â€“2 weeks)
Core features: media catalog, playback, search across songs/movies/podcasts, YouTube proxy.

Tech stack planning:

State management: Riverpod (Clean Architecture style).

Backend: Supabase for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), storage.

Media proxy: Python FastAPI service + Apache Airflow for scheduled metadata fetching (e.g., TMDb, YouTube).

Research APIs: YouTube Data API, TMDb, podcast sources.

Set up: monorepo structure, CI/CD scaffolding, environment variables.

PhaseÂ 1: Riverpod & Flutter Foundations (2â€“4 weeks)
Learn Dart: null safety, async/await, models.

Study Riverpod architecture (presentation, domain, data, application layers)

Project: Build a small demo app using Riverpod to master state management.

PhaseÂ 2: Core App Scaffold & Supabase Integration (2 weeks)
Project structure: Feature-first + Clean Architecture (presentation/domain/data layers).

Routing/UI: Bottom nav, search screen, list/detail views.

Supabase setup: user auth, schema for media metadata, data permissions.

Flutter integration: interact with Supabase via SDK

PhaseÂ 3: FastAPI Proxy & Metadata Pipeline (2â€“3 weeks)
FastAPI service:

Endpoints to fetch/crawl YouTube, TMDb metadata.

Implement caching, authentication.

Apache Airflow setup:

DAGs for scheduled scraping/updating of content metadata.

Store updated records in Supabase/PostgreSQL.

Connect Flutter app: call FastAPI endpoints via Riverpod data layer.

PhaseÂ 4: Media Playback UIs (3â€“4 weeks)
Audio playback: songs & podcasts with progress UI.

Video playback: embed trailers via youtube_player_flutter.

State and caching: Riverpod providers for playback state.

PhaseÂ 5: State, Persistence & Offline (2â€“3 weeks)
Riverpod advanced:

AsyncNotifier for data flows (Supabase, proxy).

Local caching with Hive or SQLite.

Favorites/history: persist user interactions and sync.

PhaseÂ 6: Authentication & Profiles (2 weeks)
Supabase Auth: email/password, OAuth (Google/Spotify).

Profile UI: user settings, preferences.

Auth flow: manage login/logout state via Riverpod.

PhaseÂ 7: Advanced Features (3â€“4 weeks)
Push notifications: new media alerts.

Subscriptions: Follow artists, podcasts.

Analytics: usage metrics in Supabase, Airflow workflows.

Background playback: App lifecycle handling in Flutter.

PhaseÂ 8: Testing, Performance & Deployment (2â€“3 weeks)
Testing:

Unit tests for domain logic.

Widget tests for UI.

Integration tests for flows.

API testing for FastAPI.

CI/CD pipelines:

Flutter builds (web, iOS, Android).

Docker build/test for FastAPI & Airflow.

Performance profiling: Flutter DevTools, database indices.

PhaseÂ 9: Polish & Launch (2 weeks)
UX polish: animations, themes.

Beta testing, feedback loop.

Deploy FastAPI and Airflow, secure endpoints.

App Store / Play Store releases.

FastAPI & Airflow:

FastAPI: lightweight, ideal for building proxy APIs.

Airflow: handles scheduled metadata fetch jobs (TMDb, YouTube, etc), ensures freshness.

âœ… Next Actions
Start PhaseÂ 1: Set up Riverpod scaffold and learn its clean architecture.

Initiate PhaseÂ 2: Create your Supabase project and integrate it with Flutter.

Plan PhaseÂ 3: Prototype FastAPI endpoints and an initial Airflow DAG.
