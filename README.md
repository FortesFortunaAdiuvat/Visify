# Visify

Visify aims to empower users through media. The mobile app is built with Flutter and currently targets Android and iOS. A separate Next.js project will power the web experience.

## Mobile (Flutter)

The Flutter app shows a mocked catalog of movies while the backend is under development.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
flutter run
```

## Web (Next.js)

A placeholder Next.js project resides in the `web` directory.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```
